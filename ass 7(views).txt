1. Create a view D_10EMP containing details of employees in department 10.
 

Create view D_10EMP
      (Emp_no, Name, Salary, Dept_no)
      as select
      EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DEPTNO from emp where DEPTNO=10;

create view d_10emp as 
select * from emp where deptno =10;


2. Create a view Dept_Summary containing Dname, MINSal, MAXSal, AVGSal.

 and TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'HH24') between 9 and 17 
 and TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'D') between 2 and 6
 with CHECK option;

Enter value for employeename: SCOTT
old   2: as select EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL from emp where Ename='&Employeename' and

     DEPTNO from dept)
 with CHECK option;


6. Create a READ only view EMP_READ from emp table which contains job, minsal, maxsal.


 Create view EMP_READ
 (Job, minsal, maxsal)
 as select JOB, min (SAL), max (SAL) from emp group by JOB
 with READ ONLY;


7. Table Client_master
 
A. Create a view vw_clent_master using Client_no, Name, Address1 and Bal_due

create view vw_client_master
(Client_no, Name, Address1, Bal_due)
 as select
 CLIENT_NO, NAME, ADDRESS1, BALANCE_DUE from client_master;



i. Insert at least 3 records to vw_client_master.

 INSERT INTO vw_client_master VALUES
 ('C007','Sita','B/34',2200);



INSERT INTO vw_client_master VALUES
 ('C008','Seema','v_14',2900);
 row created.


 INSERT INTO vw_client_master VALUES
('C009','Riya','I/4',4900);



ii. Update a record to vw_client_master.


 Update vw_client_master set CLIENT_NO='C009' where CLIENT_NO='C008';


iii. Delete a record from vw_client_master.


Delete from vw_client_master where client_no='C009';


And check that the above operation if the base table is affected or not.

->SQL>Select * from client_master;
Use this command to check the implementations.


B. Create a view Vw_sales_det using Order_no, Order date, Product_no, Qty_ordered, and order_status for all order which have already marked as ‘Backorder’. (Using the tables sales_order, sales_order_details).


 create or replace view Vw_sales_det
 (Order_no, Order_date, Product_no, Qty_ordered, order_status)
 as select
 sales_order. ORDER_NO, ORDER_DATE, PRODUCT_NO, QTY_DISP, ORDER_STATUS from sales_order, sales_order_details where sales_order. ORDER_NO=sales_order_details.ORDER_NO and ORDER_STATUS='Backorder';

View created.


i. Insert a record to vw_sales_det.

SQL> INSERT INTO Vw_sales_det VALUE
    2 (019009,’27-JAN-96’,’P07970’,5,’Backorder’);

ERROR: View or function ‘Vw_sales_det’ is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.


ii. Update the client_no for a particular order_no.
